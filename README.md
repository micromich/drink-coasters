# Visualising Ocean Temperature Anomalies Data as Drink Coasters
This project was done for a group assignment on a Data Visualisation course. With HTML and SVG, we transformed the data into points around a circle and then connected each of them using a line to create a rugged outline (left image). We used Illustrator to remove unwanted lines, add labels, and add some decorative illustration (right image).

Here is the set of three coasters we created. (From left to right: We use global data, northern hemisphere data, and southern hemisphere data).

Finally, we laser cut them to create thin wooden coasters.

# Dataset
The dataset comprises of ocean temperature anomalies in January from 1900 to 2018. A CSV of the dataset was first downloaded and then converted into a JSON format to be used in the HTML files. For reference, the dataset can be found in dataset/ or in the individual HTML files.

The dataset was sourced from [NOAA National Centers for Environmental information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series/shem/ocean/1/1/1900-2018). 

Regions: Global, Southern Hemisphere, Northern Hemisphere
