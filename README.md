# Visualising Ocean Temperature Anomalies Data as Drink Coasters
This project was done for a group assignment on a Data Visualisation course. With HTML and SVG, we transformed the data into points around a circle and then connected each of them using a line to create a rugged outline.



Data used in wave-coaster.html can be found in dataset/global.txt

# Dataset
The dataset comprises of ocean temperature anomalies in January from 1900 to 2018. A CSV of the dataset was first downloaded and then converted into a JSON format to be used in the HTML files. 

The dataset was sourced from [NOAA National Centers for Environmental information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series/shem/ocean/1/1/1900-2018). 

The three HTML files - wave-coaster.html, wave-coaster-North.html, and wave-coaster-South.html - use data from global.txt, northern_hemisphere.txt, and southern_hemisphere.txt respectively.

For reference, the dataset can be found in dataset/ or in the individual HTML files.

Regions: Global, Southern Hemisphere, Northern Hemisphere
